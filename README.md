### Summary

This is an experimental "forum" based on the observation that Haskell programmers _love_ designing typed APIs. Its purpose is to provide a place to discuss improving the quality and ergonomics of our library ecosystem.

[Take me there!](https://github.com/haskell-api-discussions/haskell-api-discussions/issues)

### Example use cases

+ You'd like feedback on an unpublished library

+ You have an idea about how to improve a Haskell library's API, but would like feedback before contacting the maintainer

+ You suspect a library's API could be improved, but don't yet have a concrete proposal

+ You want to discuss a library design technique in general (e.g. the use of [`backpack`](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Backpack))

+ You want to sketch out a top-down design of a library that doesn't exist yet

In general, let's not limit our ideas based on concerns of breaking backwards compatibility. That is, let's first try to navigate towards the ideal solution to a problem, and then reflect on how realistic it is to actually get there.

### Rules

There really are no hard rules, but we'd like to maintain a friendly environment for programmers of all skill levels. Here are some communication guidelines:

1. Help keep discussions on track.

   GitHub issues are linear and comments cannot be collapsed, so be mindful of accidentally derailing a thread.

2. Avoid using the thumbs-down emoji.

   To keep the conversation constructive, consider explaining any disagreement you have with words.
