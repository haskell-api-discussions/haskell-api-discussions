Really, nothing to see here. Toying with some ideas discussed in 
[this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/83qcak/haskell_needs_better_libraries_a_proposal/) and it's 
possible a GitHub organization is a satisfactory forum for what I'm trying to build. Problem is, I'm not quite sure what I'm 
trying to build yet. So, really, nothing to see here. Just me talking to myself. La la la. Please have a look around the issue
tracker wherein I talk to myself some more.
